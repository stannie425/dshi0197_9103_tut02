# Part1-Image Technique Inspiration

**Chosen Artwork:** Piet Mondrian, *Broadway Boogie Woogie* (1942–43) 

I am inspired by Mondrian’s use of geometric grids and vibrant colour blocks to represent the rhythm of New York’s jazz age.  
The painting translates musical tempo into visual composition through repetition, contrast, and balance.  
For my project, I aim to recreate this rhythmic modularity using code — a grid of coloured cells that respond dynamically to stimuli.  
This technique suits the assignment because it is highly modular, adaptable to animation, and captures the energetic interplay between order and improvisation.

# Part2-Coding Technique Exploration#
**Technique:** Object-oriented grid structure with p5.js & audio amplitude mapping

Using a class-based grid in p5.js allows each cell to control its colour and brightness independently, while a manager class defines layout and resizing.
By later mapping audio amplitude and frequency bands to each cell’s brightness or flicker rate, the grid can visually “dance” with sound — echoing Mondrian’s Boogie Woogie rhythm.
This approach blends visual order with musical motion, enabling expressive and synchronised animation.
